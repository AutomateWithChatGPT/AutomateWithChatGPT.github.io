# Make it compatible with Windows 11

To make the example Roblox Lua commands compatible with Windows 11, you do not need to change the code itself. Roblox Studio is fully supported on Windows 11, and all scripting—including the examples provided—works within the Roblox Studio interface regardless of your operating system.

Here’s what you need to do:

- **Install Roblox Studio:** Download and install Roblox Studio from the official Roblox website. It runs natively on Windows 11.
- **Use Scripts in Roblox Studio:** Open Roblox Studio (on Windows 11), create or open your game project, and paste the example commands into LocalScript or Script objects as appropriate.
- **No Additional Steps Are Needed:** Lua scripting inside Roblox Studio is platform-independent—the same code runs on Windows 11, Windows 10, or other supported systems.

**Summary:**
Simply run Roblox Studio on Windows 11 and use the given Roblox Lua scripting commands exactly as shown—no changes are needed for compatibility. All Roblox development best practices and commands work seamlessly on Windows 11.
